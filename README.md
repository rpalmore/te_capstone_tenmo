# te_capstone_tenmo

I worked on this Tech Elevator project with fellow student Odgerel Jamsranjav over the course of five days. We were tasked with writing a RESTful API server and command-line application as part of our 14-week Java bootcamp. Tech Elevator provided some starting code -- including all of the login and register functionality.

This capstone marked the end of our second module. You can learn more about Tech Elevator's coding bootcamps here: https://www.techelevator.com/.

For full details about this assignment, please review the TEnmo project readme here: https://github.com/rpalmore/te_capstone_tenmo/blob/main/java/README.md

There is of course still work to be done here and I plan to keep chipping away at it. 

A big thanks to my coding partner Odgerel and the awewome instructors Margaret Green, Gregor Dzierzon, Andy Chong Sam and Joshua Mack for their support.
